# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning



## Overview:

This project focuses on the detection of brain tumors through advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, I developed a robust deep learning model capable of analyzing MRI scans of the brain. Additionally, I integrated a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn to enhance detection accuracy.



## Features:

__Deep Learning Model__: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for effective image classification.

__Image Processing__: Employs OpenCV to preprocess MRI images, ensuring optimal input for the model.

__User-Friendly Web Interface__: A simple web application where users can upload MRI images and receive instant feedback on whether a brain tumor is present.

__Model Performance__: Includes metrics and evaluations to demonstrate the model's accuracy and reliability.




## Usage:

Upload an MRI image of the brain, and the model will analyze it to determine the presence of a tumor. The result will be displayed on the screen.




## Conclusion:

This project aims to assist in the early detection of brain tumors, contributing to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Feel free to explore, contribute, and improve upon this work!
